 * 
 * The image stream is recorded to a set of files. The size of each file is
 * limited to 2GB. The Ladybug library names the recorded stream files 
 * automatically according to the name specified by pszBaseFileName. 
 * For example, if pszBaseFileName is "c:\\ladybug\\myStream" or 
 * "c:\\ladybug\\myStream.pgr", the recorded files will be named
 * "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000000.pgr", "c:\\ladybug\myStream-000001.pgr", 
 * "c:\\ladybug\\myStream-000002.pgr", etc.. Here, "c:\\ladybug\myStream" 
 * is the base name of this stream.
 * 
 * If the first stream file name exists, the Ladybug library automatically
 * increases the first three digits of the numbers in the file name to 
 * find another available name. For example, if "myStream-000000.pgr" 
 * exists, "myStream-001000.pgr" will be used as the first
 * stream file name. The stream will be recorded to "myStream-001000.pgr",
